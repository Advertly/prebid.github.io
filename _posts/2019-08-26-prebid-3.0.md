## Prebid.js 3.0 major release announcement

The Prebid core team is excited to announce a major Prebid.js release, 3.0! The main items to be included in this release are as follows:

* Upgrade all bidder adapters to HTTPS all the time. 
* Misc legacy APIs and functions will be removed (should be a minor publisher impact) -  [link](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/issues/4118)
* Unbundle PubCommon ID and Unified ID from the User ID module build
* Fix for `getHighestCpmBids` to not return renderered bids [link](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/issues/2959)
* Remove the legacy PBS adapter endpoint support [link](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/issues/4172)

### Adapter maintainers action required

#### Ensure your bidder doesn't use deprecated functions

**Referrer detection and related code**

Bidder adapters should review their implementation to see if they are relying on getting referrer information from updated APIs in `utils.js` and instead use the new [referrer methods](http://prebid.org/dev-docs/bidder-adaptor.html#referrers) on the bid request (`bidderRequest.refererInfo`).

**Important**
If you are using a deprecated function, your bidder adapter will be removed from the 3.0 branch. You will need to re-submit compliant code. Please target re-submission by Nov 1st 2019. This will give enough time for the core team to review and target the release of mid November. 

  
#### Verify bidder supports HTTPS

We ask all bidder adapters to ensure they are compliant with secure requests to their endpoints (HTTPS) since it is already a requirement for bidders to support it on secure pages this should hopefully not be a big issue. The prebid core team will automatically update all the endpoints to secure if they are not already for the 3.0 release. 


### Target release date
Mid November 2019
